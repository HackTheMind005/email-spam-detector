# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Python 🧠

This is a Machine Learning project built using Python to detect whether an email is spam or not.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- sklearn (TfidfVectorizer, MultinomialNB, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

## 📊 Dataset:
We used a labeled dataset of 5,000+ emails with two categories: "spam" and "ham" (not spam).
Dataset Source: [UCI SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection)

## 🧪 Process:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Text Vectorization using TfidfVectorizer
3. Model Building using Naive Bayes Classifier
4. Accuracy Evaluation & Testing

## ✅ Result:
Achieved ~96% accuracy on test data.
